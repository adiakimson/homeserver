Home Server for my parents

# Hardware specs
My home server is developed using HP Thin client t630.
It supports 2 M2 disks (NOT NVME!), one of them uses FreeNAS, the other serves as storage disk.
This repo contains my roadpath to achieve multiple-task home server to support my parents in their everyday life.
Enjoy!
